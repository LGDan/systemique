# Welcome to Systemique

**Systemique** is a browser-based visual systems design tool that helps you design, document, and validate complex systems by connecting components together.

## What is Systemique?

Systemique lets you build systems visually using a drag-and-drop interface. Each component has inputs and outputs (interfaces) that can be connected to other components, creating a complete system architecture. Components can be nested into subsystems, allowing you to design hierarchical systems of any complexity.

## Key Use Cases

- **System Architecture Design**: Visualize and design complex systems with interconnected components
- **Hardware Design**: Model physical systems with power, data, and signal connections
- **Software Architecture**: Design software systems with defined interfaces and dependencies
- **Documentation**: Automatically generate bills of materials and system documentation
- **Security Analysis**: Audit system boundaries and interface access levels
- **Component Libraries**: Build reusable component libraries for consistent design patterns

## Quick Start

1. **Drag components** from the palette onto the canvas
2. **Connect components** by dragging from output to input interfaces
3. **Configure properties** by selecting components and editing in the right panel
4. **Drill down** into components to design nested subsystems
5. **Export** your system as JSON with full documentation
